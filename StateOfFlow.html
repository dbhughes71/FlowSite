  <h2>What is Flow?</h2>

  <p>“Flow” is a heightened state of consciousness, deep focus and optimal decision-making whilst being completely immersed in a challenging engaging activity which is well matched to our skills and abilities. In this state our brains process information
    faster and more deeply with enhanced creativity, pattern recognition, learning and risk taking, resulting in "optimal performance". Every action and decision flows seamlessly from the last. Analytical and intuitive mental process are both engaged
    in the solving "the problem".</p>

  <p>Most importantly every human being is born with the capacity for achieving Flow and if you reflect carefully on your past experiences you may identify that you've had these experiences of optimal performance whilst doing some fairly mundane and arbitrary
    activities.
  </p>

  <p>The purpose of this site and our objective is to help you find ways and opportunities to achieve it more consistently at work. Why? Well, we believe it will make you happier at work and more engaged. It will certainly accelerate your learning and amplify
    your productivity and creativity. When teams jointly share a state of flow, they deepen their relationship as they co-create and as the DHS tribe - we expect we'll deliver superior results and be a more effective survivor in the concrete jungle!</p>

  <p>Interestingly, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Eriksson and Toyota are implementing programs to exploit Flow on an individual basis as well as an integral part of their organisational culture.</p>

  <h2>How does it work?</h2>

  <p>Electronencephalography (EEG) and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) technologies have enabled neuroscientists to clearly see the activity of different parts of the brain under various conditions and how those parts talk to each other. When
    the brain goes into a state of Flow a measurable phenomenon called <b> transient hypofrontality</b> occurs in which it shuts down some parts of the pre-frontal cortex to redirect energy to areas most needed for increased performance and focus on a
    specific task. As such a dynamic balance is negotiated between the slow processing of the conscious mental processes in the pre-frontal cortex and the high speed processing of the intuitive limbic system processes. It does this by releasing 5 neurotransmitter
    hormones, which are "information molecules" to either excite or inhibit parts of the brain and nervous system:</p>

  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/PET-image.jpg/800px-PET-image.jpg" Align="top" width=200px;>

  <ul>
    <li>Dopamine: typically released when we are about to encounter something novel or take a risk, it increases our attention, creativity, information flow, pattern recognition in the brain, heart rate, blood pressure and muscle firing timing. The net effect
      is that we're poised for enhanced data processing. The neurotransmitter also rewards exploratory behaviour.</li>
    <li>Norepinephrine increases neural efficiency and emotional control for enhanced data acquisition. It also plays a role in attention, heart rate and muscle tension, whilst triggering glucose release for more energy. It keeps us focused and locked on
      a task.</li>
    <li>Endorphins block pain, letting us burn harder and longer without burning out</li>
    <li>Anandamide elevates mood, dilates blood vessels and bronchial tubes (to aid respiration), and amplifies lateral thinking; i.e. a wider search of our database for relevant patterns. It also inhibits our ability to feel fear and facilitates risk taking.</li>
    <li>Serotonin is released at the tail end of the Flow experience and is a signal that the optimal state is coming to an end, and is responsible for that "after glow" sensation. Alongside oxytocin, serotonin makes one feel open, expansive and empathetic
      and is said to reinforce social bonding with others. The benefits of entire teams going into Flow together become obvious.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Consequently, through this state, stress hormones are flushed out of your body, auto-immune system is amplified and your nervous system regenerates. Flow is the only time these 5 chemicals are released at the same time. The effect of hypofrontality
    is an experience which the founding psychologist of Flow, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's research of literally thousands of subjects and more recently Steven Kotler's interviews with extreme athletes characterise as:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Profound mental clarity</li>
    <li>High degree of concentration on a limited field of attention</li>
    <li>Emotional detachment and a loss of feeling self-conscious</li>
    <li>A distorted sense of time</li>
    <li>A sense of personal control over the situation</li>
    <li>The activity is intrinsically rewarding - a sense of joy about the activity for its own sake</li>
    <li>A lack of awareness of bodily needs</li>
    <li>A sense of being on auto-pilot: a fluid transition from one decision or idea to the next</li>
    <li>A quieting of voice of doubt and self-criticism that tends to undermine your progress and efforts</li>
    <li>A sense that your "gut" is speaking to you</li>
    <li>Feeling at one with the activity or subject of focus</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The experience is variable in intensity and duration lasting from minutes to hours depending on the voracity of the transient hypofrontality.</p>

  <h2>What can it do for you?</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>10-year study by McKinsey showed top executives reported being 5 time more productive in flow and if you could increase your time spent in flow by 15-20% your productivity would double.</li>
    <li>John Hagel, co-founder of Deloitte’s Centre for the Edge, “People and organisations who covered the most distance in the shortest time were always the ones who were tapping into passion and finding flow”.</li>
    <li>DARPA found military snipers training in a state of flow learned 230% faster than normal.</li>
    <li>Jamie Wheal, Executive Director of the Flow Genome Project says “Researchers describe flow as the source code of intrinsic motivation. Once an experience produces the state, we will go to extraordinary lengths to get more of it." This means if you
      like the state and you like what it's doing for you, it won't be very hard to convince yourself to do more of it.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>How do we get into Flow and how do we get more of it?</h2>

  <p>There are about 17 triggers for individuals and group to go into Flow. See link below for more, but here are the most salient triggers that pertain to an individual:</p>

  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Challenge_vs_skill.svg" Align="top" width=400px;>

  <ul>
    <li>Intense focus: producing flow requires long periods of uninterrupted concentration, no multi-tasking, solitude or a good pairing partner that enhances the state.</li>
    <li>Clear goals prevent the mind from wondering. It is essential that you are very clear on what your goal / objective is for the Flow session before you start.</li>
    <li>Immediate feedback on tracking to the goal and improvement further cements focus. If you're working alone, this may be hard, unless you are using technologies and methods that provide this; e.g. good pairing partner, continuous integration systems,
      automated testing tools.</li>
    <li>Challenge/skill ratio: Flow exists near the midline between boredom and anxiety. If the task is too dull, attention disengages and action and awareness cannot merge. If it's too hard, fear starts to spike and we start looking for an exit. The sweet
      spot rule of thumb is 4% challenge above your skill level for the task. See the following diagram Flow Model (M Csikszentmihalyi 1990) to understand this corridor of success for flow to occur.</li>

    <li>The activity must be intrinsically rewarding to you.</li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <p>It takes approximately 15 minutes to become fully immersed in Flow with all the right conditions at play. During this time you are particularly sensitive to noise and interruption. Each time you are interrupted you need an additional 15 minutes immersion
    time.
  </p>
  <p>For example if the average phone call is 5mins, then the total cost in flow time is 20mins. Worse still: a WhatsApp/Facebook/Twitter message or a “quick question” from you manager or colleague that takes you less than 10s to respond, costs you another
    15mins of flow time.</p>
  <p>Not only is task switching is the enemy of Flow, it is responsible for an additional tax on your effectiveness by further reducing your productivity by an estimated 40%. So we should try to give thought to how we can create an environment where high
    flow work (creative innovative processes) can be isolated from high task switching work to maximise optimal performance. It's clear though that some roles (dev manager, service desk agent, project manager) have a high task switching element by their
    very nature and other less so - this can't be avoided and can't be changed. However, through careful time and priority management an individual can increase their opportunities for Flow. The effects of Flow make it work like a lever; i.e. small changes
    can have a massive impact on your effectiveness, productivity, general level of contentment at work and health. Just think if you could find just 1 hour a day for pure Flow!</p>
  <p>Another side effect of this notion is how we measure effort and progress. Our time accounting in the office (devsched) really focuses on "body time"; how long have you been working on this task in this week? When we should really be asking how much
    uninterrupted time (Flow time) have you’ve spent on a task operating at full potential. I think you'll find these two numbers to be quite different at times. Using the McKinsey research results, a fully fragmented 20h of effort in a week could theoretically
    be completed in 4h uninterrupted Flow time!</p>
  <p>So what can you do to improve matters. Well let me say you’re probably incidentally going covert on everybody already. You’re probably hiding out at home, the coffee shop, the basement, coming in late, coming in early, leaving late in an attempt to
    find some Flow time and you didn’t even know it.</p>
  <p>But if you examine your favourite Flow hide-out through the lens of the Flow triggers mentioned above, how conducive are they really for you. Maybe by making some small changes in line with these triggers you can radically improve the quality and voracity
    of your Flow state! Your optimal performance is mostly in you control.</p>

  <p>First, get to know yourself. Take a stab at this fun <a href="http://www.flowgenomeproject.co/">survey</a> on the Flow Genome Project website to get a better understanding of your Flow Profile and how best you trigger into this state.
